# The Node Land

Welcome to **Node-Land**, a public repository of small, useful, and beginner-friendly Node.js + TypeScript packages created and maintained by [Ravi Pandey](https://https://imravidev.vercel.app/) – a CSE student passionate about building real-world tools for developers.

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

As a computer science student, I faced repeated challenges while working on cool projects – especially when it came to:

- 🧩 Finding reliable, well-documented packages
- 🐞 Fixing bugs in existing libraries
- 🏗️ Building simple tools without unnecessary overhead

So I started this repo to **build my own lightweight packages**, solve real problems, and help others who are tired of spending hours debugging broken dependencies.

This repository is designed to be:
- 📚 A **learning ground** for new developers
- 🛠️ A **toolbox** of plug-and-play solutions
- 🤝 A **community-driven platform** to fix bugs and build awesome things together

---

## 🤔 Who Should Use This?

- Students and beginners building side projects
- Developers tired of heavy libraries for simple features
- Anyone who loves open-source and wants to contribute small but impactful solutions

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

- 🎙️ `text-to-speech-mp3`: Convert text to `.mp3` audio using Google Translate
- 🧩 More simple utility packages coming soon...
- 🐛 Bug Reports + Fixes section to help you overcome common errors

---

## 🛠 How to Use

Each package has its own folder and contains:
- A `README.md` for usage
- Source code (written in TypeScript or JavaScript)
- Package.json
- Tests (if applicable)

You can install any published package via `npm install <package-name>` or clone this repo and run locally.
